This is a blog where I would like to explore ideas that I haven't fully fleshed out. I find that I can best express my ideas through writing as opposed to conversation. Maybe this is a place where I can resolve my [esprit de l'escalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27esprit_de_l%27escalier). I hope it can be a place where I can refer other people to better elucidate my ideas in conversation, because it's easy to forget all of the reasons why you're right in the heat of the moment.

I am a software engineer, so I know that naming your first thing 'Hello World' is more than a bit of a cliche. However, I like the idea of constraining as much as possible at the beginning, so you're not trying to do too many new things at once. I'm already creating this blog using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) static site generator and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), so the few things I have to think about at the outset, the better.

I am deeply interested in the social sciences and philosophy, though I haven't studied them in any rigorous manner. I am a frequent listener to podcasts, follower of YouTube channels and a blog reader. I would be burying the lead if I didn't say that I am very inspired by [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/). I think that is the gold standard next to which to compare a philosophy blog - though I haven't looked around for other onces that hard. I of course would like to do my own thing with this - ideally, this could be a great platform for exploring the intersections between computer science and philosophy/the social sciences. One fantastic article that shows a few examples of this is [Seeing Around Corners](https://www.google.com/search?q=seeing+around+corners+atlantic&oq=seeing&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j35i39j0l5j69i60.1880j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). I'll have a page for links to articles/blogs/videos that I think/talk about frequently.

My hopes for this blog are pretty simple. I hope that it will improve my communications skills. I hope that it will motivate me to show my different projects (success or failure). I hope that I will look back on my earlier writing (this included) and be embarassed.

I'm not sure yet whether I would like to have more free-form or structured posts - I suppose that's something I'll feel out in the future. Luckily, no one is reading it at this early stage (maybe ever), so I have some leeway to experiment.
